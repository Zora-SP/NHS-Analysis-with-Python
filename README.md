<h2>Project Overview: NHS Service Utilisation Analysis</h2>

<p>As part of the Data Analytics using Python course, this project focused on analysing NHS service utilisation and the impact of missed appointments, providing actionable recommendations to optimise resource allocation and efficiency.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The NHS faces ongoing challenges in balancing its resources with increasing service demands. Missed appointments represent a significant cost factor, requiring a data-driven approach to understand and mitigate their impact.</p>

<h3>Project Objective</h3>
<p>This project aimed to assess the causes and impact of missed appointments on NHS resource allocation, providing insights into capacity usage and strategies for efficiency improvements.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>Using Python in Jupyter Notebooks, I conducted diagnostic analysis involving data wrangling, visualisation (Matplotlib and Seaborn), and statistical assessment to identify patterns in service usage and propose actionable solutions.</p>
